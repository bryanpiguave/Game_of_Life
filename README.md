### Game of Life 
The Game of life proposed by John Conway in 1970 is a zero-player game that shows the evolution of an initial universe guided by the following rules: 
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

This game was developed in python and javascript
